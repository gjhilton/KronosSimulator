Desktop application for configuring a 32pixel RGB led strip animation.

Supply a PNG or JPEG image - each column maps to an led, each row to an animation step.
Hit save to output the animation data as an Arduino sketch ready for upload.

nb - on a standard Arduino Duemillenove, you have enough memory for sixteen frames of animation for 32 pixels (ie a 32x16 pix image)
